## Our Founders

**JQ Sirls** - CEO & Founder  
JQ is an interdisciplinary artist, designer, author, and entrepreneur. At age seven, he envisioned the world of Fantoria, which became the foundation for his creative work. He's the author of acclaimed children's books including *The Moon Is Following Me*, *The Book of Imaginary Friends*, and the upcoming *Big Blue* (June 2025). JQ's philosophy centers on preserving childlike wonder in adults, inspired by early Disney and J.M. Barrie—creating stories made for children that give adults permission to feel wonder again.
