# Storytailor FAQ - Complete Guide

Comprehensive answers to questions about Storytailor, what it is, how it works, and what makes it different.

---

## What is Storytailor?

Storytailor creates stories for the exact moment a child is in.

A scraped knee. A fight with a friend. A burst of silliness before bed. A long hospital wait. Stories flex to reflect how a child feels right now, helping them name emotions, laugh at worries, or hear encouragement in a way they are ready to receive.

**For parents**, that might mean easing a tough bedtime.  
**For grandparents**, sparking giggles from across the country.  
**For foster parents**, building trust with a child learning to feel safe.  
**For teachers**, turning a classroom moment into a playful lesson.  
**For therapists and child-life specialists**, helping children share heavy feelings without making them heavier.

### We do not make books. We do not want to.

Books are sacred works of art created by human hands. Storytailor was founded by an award-winning author and illustrator who believes books should never be automated. Our role is different.

We use technology as a tool to help families shape stories in real time. The heart of it comes from people. Parents, caregivers, and professionals stay in control. They know the child best. Storytailor helps capture the moment—an imaginative snapshot families can remember not just for the words, but for what the story meant at that time.

## What ages is Storytailor best for?

**Storytailor is designed for children 10 and under.**

These are the years when imagination is loud and emotions are often bigger than language. Stories give children a way to express what they feel, whether that's a toddler giggling at a silly dragon, a kindergartener working through a playground conflict, or a 10-year-old beginning to name more complex emotions.

---

## Is Storytailor safe for children?

**Yes. Safety is foundational.**

Storytailor never diagnoses, never labels, and never replaces the role of a caregiver or professional. Stories are informed by bibliotherapy principles, where storytelling helps children explore emotions, build resilience, and communicate more openly.

**This does not mean lectures or lessons.**  
It means a silly dragon who loves waffles helping a child talk about worry.  
A playful fox helping them feel brave after a rough day.

Whimsy is the doorway. Emotions are what come through.

**Our Safety Commitments:**
- Fully COPPA compliant
- We do not sell or share data
- Adults remain in control at all times
- Profanity and unsafe content are blocked
- Stories and illustrations stay age-appropriate and child-safe

## Is Storytailor therapy?

**No.**

Storytailor is not therapy and does not claim to be. It does not diagnose, treat, or replace mental health care.

It is informed by therapeutic storytelling practices and designed to support emotional expression, connection, and communication. Parents, caregivers, teachers, and professionals decide how and when to use it.

---

## Can my child use Storytailor alone?

**Storytailor is designed for shared experiences.**

Adults guide the experience and remain in control. Older children may participate more independently, but Storytailor is built to strengthen connection within a child's care circle, not replace it.

Stories work best when they are created together.

---

## Do I need to download an app?

**No.**

Storytailor works on modern phones, tablets, and computers through the browser. No app required. This keeps it flexible for families, classrooms, hospitals, and shared devices.

---

## Can stories be created in different languages?

**Yes.**

Storytailor supports multiple languages so families and communities can create stories in the words that matter most to them. This makes it easier for bilingual households, multicultural classrooms, and caregivers to share stories in a child's native language.

## Do you make books?

### Direct response from JQ Sirls, CEO

**No. And that choice is intentional.**

Storytailor creates stories that live in the moment. They are shaped around what a child is feeling right now and the connection they are sharing with someone in their care circle. These stories are meant to be experienced together, not archived first and understood later.

Sometimes a family falls in love with a story. When that happens, they can save it, print it, keep it, share it. That part belongs to them. We do not get in the way of that.

**But we do not sell books.**

Books are an art form. They deserve the hands, instincts, and life experience of human authors and illustrators. As a children's book author and illustrator myself, I care deeply about that craft. Print-on-demand shortcuts do not honor it.

There is something else that matters. **Nostalgia is not instant.** A child does not build lifelong emotional memory from a digital story turned into a printed object weeks later. Nostalgia comes from moments that repeat, linger, and age alongside them. A bookstore visit. A worn spine. A story that stays the same while the child changes.

**Storytailor is different by design.**

We exist for the moment when a child needs a story now. Before bedtime. In a hospital room. After a hard day. During a quiet afternoon. By the time a printed book would arrive, that moment has passed. The child has moved on, as children do.

**Books last on shelves.**  
**Storytailor lives in the moment.**

We are not here to replace books. We are here to give families something books cannot. A story that meets a child exactly where they are, exactly when they need it.

## Can I print or save stories?

**Yes.**

Families can save stories, print them, and keep them if they choose. Storytailor does not limit how families enjoy the stories they create.

The printed version is optional. The experience comes first.

---

## Can I share stories with teachers, counselors, or family members?

**Yes.**

Stories can be shared with trusted adults in a child's care circle. Many families use stories as a gentle way to help teachers, counselors, or therapists understand what a child is working through without putting pressure on the child to explain it themselves.

---

## How is Storytailor different from other story apps?

**Storytailor is not a reading app, a content library, or a game.**

Stories are created in real time, shaped around a child's emotions and lived experiences. There are no feeds to scroll, no points to earn, and no fixed stories to "complete."

The focus is connection, imagination, and emotional expression, guided by the adults who know the child best.

---

## Do you collect or sell my child's data?

**No.**

We do not sell data. We do not share data. Storytailor is built to respect children's privacy and family trust. Adults remain in control of the experience and any saved content.

**Privacy Commitment:**
- COPPA compliant
- No data sales or sharing
- Parent controls for children under 13
- Transparent data practices
- Family trust is foundational

## Can Storytailor help with big emotions?
