**Try:** "A small purple dragon with sparkly wings and a friendly smile"

### Choose Meaningful Traits
Pick personality traits that matter to your child or the story you want to tell.

### Represent Your Child
Create characters that look like, act like, or share experiences with your child. Seeing themselves as the hero is powerful!

### Have Fun with It
There are no wrong answers! Create silly characters, serious characters, realistic or fantastical—it's your story world.
