## The Breakthrough

By applying the wheelchair imagination transformation pattern to halo devices, we:

1. ✅ Eliminated medical language completely
2. ✅ Expanded age range from 4-5 to 5-8+

4. ✅ Achieved 100% filter success
5. ✅ Made children feel POWERFUL not medical

**Mission accomplished:** That child in the hospital can now see themselves as a superhero with danger-detection powers. 🎯
