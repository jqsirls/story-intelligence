# Ready to Push to GitHub

Everything is committed and ready to push!

## Command to Run

```bash
cd "/Users/jqsirls/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Storytailor/JQ Sirls/Storytailor Inc/Projects/Storytailor Agent"
git push origin main
```

## What Will Be Pushed

## Why Push Failed Initially

Git requires authentication credentials for HTTPS push to GitHub. You'll need to:

1. Authenticate with GitHub (token or credentials)
2. Run the push command manually
3. Or use SSH instead of HTTPS

## After Pushing

Your entire team will have access to:
- The universal halo device solution
- All species anatomy profiles
- Complete inclusivity trait system
- Test scripts and results
- Documentation of the journey

**Everything is deployed and working in production. The push to GitHub is just for version control and team collaboration.** ✅
