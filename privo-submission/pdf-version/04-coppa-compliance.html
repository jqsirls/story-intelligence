<h1 id="coppa-compliance-documentation">COPPA Compliance
Documentation</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>COPPA compliance is central to both Storytailor (our web platform at
Storytailor.com) and Story Intelligence™ (our AI engine for future
versions and partner licensing). This document walks through our
compliance measures and explains how we’ve implemented each requirement
from COPPA regulations (16 CFR Part 312, sections §312.2-312.6).</p>
<p>Both systems share the same COPPA infrastructure, ensuring consistent
protection whether children use Storytailor 3.0 today or Storytailor 4.0
with Story Intelligence™ in the future.</p>
<h2 id="age-threshold-protection">Age Threshold Protection</h2>
<h3 id="automatic-coppa-protection">Automatic COPPA Protection</h3>
<p>When a child under 13 tries to register, COPPA protections kick in
automatically. We’ve built this protection into the database itself—not
just the application code—so there’s no way to bypass it:</p>
<p><strong>At the Database Level:</strong> - Registration fails if a
child under 13 doesn’t have a parent email address - This happens at the
database layer, before any application code runs - It’s technically
impossible to create an account for a child without parental
information</p>
<p><strong>At the Application Level:</strong> - Every child under 13
gets automatically flagged for COPPA protection - The system checks this
flag before collecting any data - Parent consent must be verified before
the child can use the service</p>
<h3 id="age-verification-process">Age Verification Process</h3>
<p><strong>During Registration:</strong> 1. The child enters their age
2. If they’re under 13, we immediately require a parent email address 3.
No parent email? Registration stops with a clear explanation 4. With
parent email? Account is created with COPPA protections enabled</p>
<p><strong>After Registration:</strong> - We check COPPA protection
status with every request - We won’t collect data until parental consent
is verified - All data operations respect these protections</p>
<h2 id="verifiable-parental-consent-vpc">Verifiable Parental Consent
(VPC)</h2>
<h3 id="coppa-312.2---verifiable-parental-consent">COPPA §312.2 -
Verifiable Parental Consent</h3>
<p>Storytailor implements a Verifiable Parental Consent (VPC) workflow
that complies with COPPA requirements.</p>
<h3 id="consent-request-process">Consent Request Process</h3>
<p>The same consent process applies to both Storytailor 3.0 and Story
Intelligence™:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Consent Request Creation</strong> - When a child
under 13 registers, a consent request is automatically created - Parent
email address is validated - Unique consent request ID is generated -
Consent request is stored with status “pending” - Consent request
expires after 7 days if not verified</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Parent Notification</strong> - Parent receives email
notification explaining: - What Storytailor does (current features in
3.0) - What Story Intelligence™ will add in the future (voice, emotion
detection) - Exactly what data will be collected - Instructions for
providing consent</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Consent Verification</strong> - Parent can verify
consent through email link - Consent verification requires validation of
request ID - Upon verification, consent status is updated to “verified”
- Consent timestamp is recorded for audit purposes</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Consent Status Tracking</strong> - System maintains
current consent status for each child - Consent status can be checked at
any time - Consent history is maintained for audit purposes</p>
<h3 id="consent-revocation">Consent Revocation</h3>
<p>Parents can revoke consent at any time: - Revocation immediately
stops all data collection - Existing data can be deleted upon parent
request - Revocation is logged and timestamped - Parent receives
confirmation of revocation</p>
<h3 id="consent-status-values">Consent Status Values</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>none:</strong> No consent request has been created</li>
<li><strong>pending:</strong> Consent request created, awaiting parent
verification</li>
<li><strong>verified:</strong> Parent has verified consent, data
collection permitted</li>
<li><strong>revoked:</strong> Parent has revoked consent, data
collection stopped</li>
</ul>
