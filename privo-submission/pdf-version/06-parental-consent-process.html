<h1 id="parental-consent-process">Parental Consent Process</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Getting verifiable parental consent is a key COPPA requirement.
Here’s how our consent process works from a parent’s perspective.</p>
<h2 id="when-consent-is-required">When Consent Is Required</h2>
<p><strong>Consent is required when:</strong> - A child under 13 years
of age registers for a Storytailor account - A child under 13 attempts
to use Storytailor services - Any data collection occurs for a child
under 13</p>
<p><strong>Consent is NOT required when:</strong> - User is 13 years of
age or older - User is a parent or guardian registering their own
account</p>
<h2 id="consent-request-process">Consent Request Process</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-child-registration">Step 1: Child Registration</h3>
<p>When a child under 13 starts to register: 1. They enter their age 2.
We see they’re under 13 and ask for a parent’s email 3. Without a parent
email, registration stops 4. With a parent email, we create the account
but lock it until the parent approves</p>
<h3 id="step-2-we-reach-out-to-parents">Step 2: We Reach Out to
Parents</h3>
<p>Once we have the parent’s email: 1. We create a consent request
(valid for 7 days) 2. We send the parent an email explaining: - What
Storytailor is (current web platform at Storytailor.com) - What Story
Intelligence™ will add in the future (voice, emotion detection) -
Exactly what data we’ll collect (current and future) - A link to our
privacy policy - How to give or deny consent</p>
<h3 id="step-3-parent-review">Step 3: Parent Review</h3>
<p>Parents can take their time to: - Read our privacy policy -
Understand what data we collect now (Storytailor 3.0) - Understand what
additional data Story Intelligence™ will collect in the future - Learn
about their rights (access, delete, export data) - Decide whether to
approve</p>
<h2 id="consent-verification-process">Consent Verification Process</h2>
<h3 id="option-1-email-link-verification">Option 1: Email Link
Verification</h3>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> 1. Parent clicks verification link in
email 2. Parent is directed to consent verification page 3. Parent
reviews consent information 4. Parent confirms consent 5. Consent status
is updated to “verified” 6. Parent receives confirmation email</p>
<h3 id="option-2-api-verification">Option 2: API Verification</h3>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> 1. Parent uses consent request ID from
email 2. Parent submits consent verification through API 3. System
validates consent request ID 4. Consent status is updated to “verified”
5. Parent receives confirmation</p>
<h3 id="consent-verification-requirements">Consent Verification
