<h1 id="security-measures">Security Measures</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Both Storytailor (our web platform) and Story Intelligence™ (our
future AI engine) use the same comprehensive security measures to
protect children’s data and ensure COPPA compliance. This document
describes our security practices and data protection measures that apply
to both products.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<h3 id="encryption-at-rest">Encryption at Rest</h3>
<p><strong>Database Encryption:</strong> - All data stored in encrypted
databases - Database-level encryption enabled - Encryption keys managed
securely - Data cannot be read without proper decryption keys</p>
<p><strong>Storage Encryption:</strong> - All file storage encrypted -
Asset storage (stories, images, audio) encrypted - Encryption keys
managed through secure key management</p>
<p><strong>Configuration and Secrets:</strong> - All configuration
secrets encrypted - API keys and credentials encrypted - Secure key
management system used</p>
<h3 id="encryption-in-transit">Encryption in Transit</h3>
<p><strong>API Communications:</strong> - All API endpoints require
HTTPS/TLS - TLS 1.3 used for all API communications - No unencrypted
data transmission allowed - Certificate validation enforced</p>
<p><strong>Database Connections:</strong> - All database connections use
SSL/TLS - Encrypted connections required - Certificate validation
enforced</p>
<p><strong>Email Delivery:</strong> - All email communications use TLS
encryption - Encrypted email delivery to parents - Secure email
transmission protocols</p>
<h2 id="access-control">Access Control</h2>
<h3 id="row-level-security-rls">Row Level Security (RLS)</h3>
<p><strong>Database-Level Security:</strong> - All database tables
protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies - Users can only access
their own data - Parents can only access their own child’s data -
Service access restricted to system operations only</p>
<p><strong>RLS Policy Enforcement:</strong> - Policies enforced at
database level - Cannot be bypassed by application code - Automatic
enforcement on all queries - User-based access control</p>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p><strong>API Authentication:</strong> - All API endpoints require
authentication - JWT Bearer tokens used for authentication - Token
validation on every request - Token expiration and refresh
mechanisms</p>
<p><strong>Token Security:</strong> - Tokens signed with secure keys -
Token expiration enforced - Token refresh required periodically -
Invalid tokens rejected immediately</p>
<h3 id="authorization">Authorization</h3>
<p><strong>User Authorization:</strong> - User-based access control -
Users can only access their own data - Parent-child relationship
verification - Service role access restricted to system operations</p>
<p><strong>Parent Authorization:</strong> - Parents must verify identity
to access child data - Parent-child relationship validated - Parent
email verification required - Authorization checked on every request</p>
<h2 id="data-access-controls">Data Access Controls</h2>
<h3 id="user-data-access">User Data Access</h3>
<p><strong>Self-Access:</strong> - Users can access their own data -
Access limited to user’s own stories, characters, and preferences -
Cannot access other users’ data</p>
<p><strong>Parent Access:</strong> - Parents can access their own
child’s data - Parent-child relationship verified - Access limited to
parent’s own children - Cannot access other children’s data</p>
<h3 id="service-access">Service Access</h3>
<p><strong>System Operations:</strong> - Service role access only for
system operations - Limited to necessary operations - All service access
logged - Regular review of service access</p>
<p><strong>Administrative Access:</strong> - Administrative access
restricted - Multi-factor authentication required - All administrative
actions logged - Regular access reviews</p>
<h2 id="audit-logging">Audit Logging</h2>
<h3 id="logged-events">Logged Events</h3>
<p><strong>Authentication Events:</strong> - User login attempts -

- Session creation and termination</p>
<p><strong>Consent Events:</strong> - Consent request creation - Consent
verification - Consent revocation - Consent status checks</p>
<p><strong>Data Access Events:</strong> - Parent data access requests -
Data export requests - Data deletion requests - Data modification
events</p>
<p><strong>Safety Events:</strong> - Safety incident detection - Parent
notifications sent - Crisis intervention triggered - Safety monitoring
events</p>
<p><strong>Security Events:</strong> - API errors and security
violations - Unauthorized access attempts - Authentication failures -
Security policy violations</p>
