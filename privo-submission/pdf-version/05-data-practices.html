<h1 id="data-practices">Data Practices</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We believe in collecting as little data as possible. This document
explains what we collect for both Storytailor (our web platform) and
Story Intelligence™ (our future AI engine), why we need it, and how long
we keep it.</p>
<p>Both products share the same data practices and retention policies,
ensuring consistent privacy protection.</p>
<h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
<h3 id="what-we-collect">What We Collect</h3>
<p>Here’s everything we collect:</p>
<p><strong>For All Users:</strong> - Age (we need this to know if COPPA
protections apply, and to create age-appropriate stories) - Email
address (for account access and communication)</p>
<p><strong>For Children Under 13 (Current - Storytailor 3.0):</strong> -
Parent email address (required by COPPA so we can get parental consent)
- Stories they create (so they can save and return to their stories) -
Character traits and preferences (to make stories feel personal)</p>
<p><strong>Additional Data When Story Intelligence™ is Integrated
(Future - Storytailor 4.0):</strong> - Voice conversations (these help
create stories through talking, and we delete them after 30 days) -
Emotional state information (helps us understand what kind of story a
child needs, and supports safety monitoring)</p>
<p><strong>For Parents:</strong> - Parent email address (for
communication and consent management) - Information provided when giving
consent for child’s account</p>
<h3 id="what-data-we-do-not-collect">What Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
<p>Storytailor does NOT collect: - Full names - Physical addresses -
Phone numbers - School information - Photos or videos - Location data
(beyond IP address for security purposes) - Social media information -
Payment information (handled by third-party payment processors)</p>
<h2 id="why-we-collect-data">Why We Collect Data</h2>
<h3 id="purpose-based-collection">Purpose-Based Collection</h3>
<p>Storytailor only collects data for the following purposes:</p>
<p><strong>1. Service Delivery</strong> - Story generation and creation
- Character management - Conversation continuity - User account
management</p>
<p><strong>2. Safety and Security</strong> - Safety incident detection -
Crisis intervention - Parent notifications - Security monitoring</p>
<p><strong>3. Compliance</strong> - Age verification (COPPA requirement)
- Parental consent management (COPPA requirement) - Legal compliance and
audit requirements</p>
<p><strong>4. Service Improvement</strong> - Anonymized emotional data
analysis (after 1 year retention period) - Service quality improvement -
User experience enhancement</p>
<p><strong>We never sell data to third parties. We never use data for
advertising or marketing purposes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-we-use-data">How We Use Data</h2>
<h3 id="story-generation-current---storytailor-3.0">Story Generation

<h3 id="safety-and-security">Safety and Security</h3>
<p><strong>Safety Incident Detection (Both Products):</strong> - Content
monitored for concerning material - Safety incidents trigger parent
notifications - Incident summaries stored (content hashed, not raw text)
- Retained for 7 years (legal requirement), then anonymized</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Safety (Story Intelligence™ - Future):</strong> -
Voice conversations will be analyzed for concerning content - Real-time
crisis detection and intervention - Advanced emotional state
monitoring</p>
<p><strong>Security Monitoring (Both Products):</strong> - IP addresses
logged for security purposes - Authentication events logged - Security
violations logged - Used for fraud prevention and security incident
response</p>
<h3 id="compliance">Compliance</h3>
<p><strong>Age Verification:</strong> - Age used to determine COPPA
protection status - Age used for age-appropriate content generation -
Stored as part of user account</p>
<p><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> - Parent email used for consent

<h3 id="automated-deletion-process">Automated Deletion Process</h3>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> 1. System automatically identifies
data that has exceeded retention period 2. Data is permanently deleted
or anonymized based on deletion strategy 3. Deletion is logged for audit
purposes 4. No manual intervention required</p>
<p><strong>Deletion Strategies:</strong> - <strong>Hard Delete:</strong>
Data is permanently removed and cannot be recovered -
<strong>Anonymization:</strong> Personal identifiers are removed, but
anonymized data may be retained for service improvement</p>
<h3 id="manual-deletion">Manual Deletion</h3>
<p><strong>Parent-Requested Deletion:</strong> - Parents can request
immediate deletion of all child data - Deletion occurs immediately upon
verified request - All child data is permanently deleted - Audit logs
are anonymized (retained for legal compliance) - Parent receives
confirmation of deletion</p>
<p><strong>User-Controlled Deletion:</strong> - Users can delete their
own stories and characters at any time - Deletion is immediate and
permanent - No recovery possible after deletion</p>
<p><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> - Account deletion removes all
associated data - All user data, stories, characters, and preferences
are deleted - Audit logs are anonymized - Parent email is deleted</p>
<h2 id="data-minimization-for-children">Data Minimization for
Children</h2>
<h3 id="enhanced-protections-for-coppa-protected-users">Enhanced
Protections for COPPA-Protected Users</h3>
<p>Children under 13 receive enhanced data protection:</p>
<p><strong>Stricter Retention:</strong> - Shorter retention periods
where possible - Faster anonymization of emotional data - Enhanced
deletion processes</p>
<p><strong>Content Protection:</strong> - Safety incident content is
hashed (not stored as raw text) - Only incident summaries stored -
Enhanced privacy protections</p>
<p><strong>Access Restrictions:</strong> - Stricter access controls -
Enhanced audit logging - Parent-only data access</p>
