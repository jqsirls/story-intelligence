<h1 id="user-journeys---coppa-compliance-in-practice">User Journeys -
COPPA Compliance in Practice</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This document shows how our COPPA compliance measures work in real
user scenarios. Each journey walks through what users experience and how
privacy protections are applied.</p>
<p><strong>Note on UI Details:</strong> The exact wording and navigation
may change as we refine the user interface (for example, “Children’s
Accounts” might become “Profiles,” or “Account Settings” might be
accessed differently). However, the underlying flows, privacy
protections, and COPPA compliance measures remain consistent regardless
of UI changes.</p>

locked—Emma cannot log in yet - Message displays: “Account created!
