# PRIVO COPPA Safe Harbor Certification Submission Package

**Company:** Storytailor Inc.  
**Submission Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** COPPA Safe Harbor Certification Application

## Package Overview

This submission package contains all documentation required for PRIVO COPPA Safe Harbor certification review for:
1. **Storytailor** - Our web platform at Storytailor.com (version 3.0, launching soon)
2. **Story Intelligence™** - Our AI engine that will power Storytailor 4.0 and be licensed to partners

We're certifying both products now to ensure COPPA compliance is maintained as we evolve from 3.0 to 4.0, and as partners license Story Intelligence™ (similar to how OpenAI licenses GPT).

All documents are standalone and contain no references to internal source code or proprietary technical documentation.
