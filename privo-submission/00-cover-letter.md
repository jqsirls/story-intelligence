Dear PRIVO Certification Team,

Thank you for meeting with us to begin our COPPA Safe Harbor certification. As discussed, we're submitting our documentation package for your review. At Storytailor, children's privacy isn't just a compliance checkbox—it's foundational to everything we build.

## About Storytailor Inc.

We're a technology company creating Storytailor, a web-based platform at Storytailor.com where children create personalized stories. We're also developing Story Intelligence™—a sophisticated AI engine that will power Storytailor's future versions and be licensed to partners, similar to how OpenAI licenses GPT technology.

**Company Information:**
- **Legal Name:** Storytailor Inc.
- **Address:** 7131 w 135th, #1074, Overland Park, KS 66223
- **CEO:** Jaqwan "JQ" Sirls

## Products Being Certified

We're seeking certification for two products:

**1. Storytailor (Version 3.0)**
Our web platform at Storytailor.com where children create personalized stories. This is launching soon and represents the consumer-facing product families will use.

**2. Story Intelligence™ (The AI Engine)**
Our proprietary multi-agent AI system with emotion detection and sophisticated story generation. This will power Storytailor 4.0 (future release with Alexa integration) and be licensed to partner platforms. We're pre-certifying this technology now so it's ready when we integrate it and when partners license it.

## Our Commitment to COPPA Compliance

We've built COPPA compliance into every layer of our system. Here's what that means in practice:

- **Automatic protection:** When a child under 13 tries to register, our system immediately requires parental consent—this happens at the database level, so there's no way around it
- **Parent control:** Parents can access, export, or delete their child's data at any time, and they can revoke consent whenever they choose
- **Data minimization:** We only collect what's truly needed to make the service work—no location data, no full names, no photos
- **Automatic cleanup:** Voice conversations are deleted after 30 days, and emotional data is anonymized after a year
- **Security throughout:** All data is encrypted both in storage and in transit, with comprehensive audit logging
