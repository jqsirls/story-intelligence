# Mental Health

In **`{{storyLanguage}}`**, write an imaginative and emotionally intelligent children’s story designed to support the development of **Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)** skills—specifically helping children navigate the emotion of **`{{mentalhealthEmotionExplored}}`**. The story should reflect **CASEL-aligned** bibliotherapy principles and be suitable for guidance from a licensed children’s therapist or child psychologist.

### Storytelling Guidelines

Build the story as a **fast-paced, comedic adventure** with:

- **Absurd problem-solving** scenes
- A **brief heartfelt scene** that brings emotional grounding
- A **suspenseful cliffhanger** to keep kids hooked
- **Humorous onomatopoeia** throughout
- A **laugh-out-loud, triumphant ending** where the hero saves the day in a totally unexpected way
