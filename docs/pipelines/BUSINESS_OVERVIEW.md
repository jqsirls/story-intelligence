## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not send all emails? Wouldn't that increase engagement?

**A**: Short-term maybe, long-term no. Users unsubscribe from noise. Veto authority earns trust. 40% open rate with 50% veto rate beats 25% open rate with 0% veto rate.

### Q: Why comparative vs absolute scoring?

**A**: Users don't understand "82/100". They understand "5 minutes faster than usual". Comparative is actionable, absolute is storage.

### Q: Why clinical review for therapeutic features? Competitors don't do this.

**A**: Liability protection, trust, credibility. We're suggesting clinical pathways to vulnerable populations. Can't afford to get this wrong.

### Q: What if referral costs exceed projections?

**A**: We track CAC per referral. If CAC >$50, we reduce reward amounts. Currently tracking $15-20 CAC, comfortable margin.

### Q: How do we measure "silence as feature"?

**A**: Veto rate, open rate, unsubscribe rate. Healthy veto rate (30-50%) + high open rate (40%) = earning trust.
