# Status Files Archived

**Date**: 2025-12-14  
**Purpose**: Record of redundant status/completion files moved to archive

## Files Archived

These files were redundant status reports from previous cleanup efforts and have been moved to `docs/archive/`:

### Root Level (moved to docs/archive/)
- `REGION_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Historical migration status
- `US_EAST_2_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` - Historical cleanup plan

### docs/ Level (moved to docs/archive/)
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Redundant with COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- `DELETION_COMPLETE.md` - Redundant status report
- `DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - Redundant summary
- `DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md` - Redundant consolidation report
- `FINAL_CLEANUP_STATUS.md` - Redundant with COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- `FINAL_STATUS.md` - Redundant with COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- `PLAN_COMPLETE.md` - Redundant status report

## Files Kept (Have Unique Value)

These files were kept because they contain unique information:

- `docs/COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Referenced in docs/README.md
- `docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` - Active operational guide
- `docs/MULTI_LENS_AUDIT.md` - Referenced in docs/README.md
- `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Referenced in docs/README.md
- `docs/AGENT_AUDIT.md` - Agent inventory information
- `docs/PACKAGE_AUDIT.md` - Package boundary analysis
- `docs/AI_MODEL_VERSION_AUDIT.md` - Model version audit
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_AUDIT.md` - Implementation vs documentation audit
- `docs/CONSISTENCY_REPORT.md` - Documentation consistency standards
- `docs/API_STATUS_UPDATE.md` - Critical API update information
- `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Production deployment information
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md` - Documentation audit results
- `docs/PRODUCTION_DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md` - Production documentation audit

## Rationale

Status files that were simple completion summaries without unique technical content were archived. Files with unique audits, analyses, or operational information were kept.
