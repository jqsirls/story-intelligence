## 💡 **KEY CONCEPTS (5-Minute Primer)**

### **Story Intelligence™**
- **Revolutionary Technology**: Created by Storytailor Inc
- **Not AI**: We say "SI Powered" not "Story Intelligence™ powered"  
- **New Category**: Story creation + off-screen activities
- **Award Caliber**: Quality that could win awards (but stays private)

### **Multi-Agent System**
- **16 Specialized Agents**: Each handles specific capabilities
- **Router Orchestration**: Central hub manages all communication
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time agent coordination via EventBridge
- **Knowledge Base**: Handles FAQ/platform queries before expensive routing

### **Quality Standards**
- **Cinema-Quality**: Pixar-level storytelling architecture
- **Gallery-Worthy**: Museum-caliber art for family treasures
- **Award-Ready**: Newbery/Caldecott quality standards
- **Private Treasures**: High quality but personal to each family

## 🎯 **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

### **You Know You're Ready When**:
✅ Knowledge Base Agent deployed and responding  
✅ Story Intelligence™ brand messaging understood  
✅ Multi-agent architecture mapped out  
✅ Quality standards framework internalized  
✅ User journey flows documented  
✅ Deployment pipeline established  

### **Red Flags to Watch For**:
🚨 Using "Story Intelligence™ powered" instead of "Story Intelligence™"  
🚨 Calling stories "books" (we create a new category)  
🚨 Commercializing individual stories (they're private treasures)  
🚨 Skipping quality standards (award-caliber is non-negotiable)
