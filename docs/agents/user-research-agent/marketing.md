## Value Proposition

Fieldnotes is a standing internal research team that never sleeps, providing adversarial truth-telling insights through five parallel analysis tracks. Currently for internal use only, with future productization planned.

## Key Features

- **Adversarial** - Challenges assumptions and detects self-deception

### Five Parallel Tracks

1. **Continuous Insight Mining** - Watches product usage, abandoned flows, retries, rage clicks
2. **Buyer Reality Checks** - Simulates and pressure-tests buyer/decision-maker expectations
