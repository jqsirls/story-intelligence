# User Research Agent - Why

**Status**: ✅ Active  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-14

## Business Rationale

Fieldnotes exists to provide an unbiased, data-driven research team that never sleeps. It fills a critical gap: most product teams lack dedicated research resources, and when they do have research, it's often one-time studies that miss continuous patterns.

## The Problem

### Traditional Research Limitations

1. **One-time studies** - Research happens quarterly or annually, missing continuous patterns
2. **Expensive** - User research studies cost $5K-20K each, consultants $10K-50K/month
3. **Biased** - Human researchers bring their own assumptions and blind spots
4. **Slow** - Weeks or months to get insights
5. **Disconnected** - Research reports sit in documents, not integrated into workflow

### What Teams Need

1. **Continuous insights** - Not one-time studies, but ongoing observation
2. **Unbiased truth** - Data-driven, not opinion-driven
3. **Early risk detection** - Catch problems before shipping
4. **Integration-native** - Insights where you work, not in a dashboard
5. **Cost-effective** - $150-300/month vs $10K-50K/month

## The Solution: Fieldnotes

### Standing Research Team

Fieldnotes operates like a full research team:
- **Never sleeps** - Continuous observation 24/7
- **Unbiased** - Data-driven, not opinion-driven
- **Adversarial** - Challenges assumptions and detects self-deception
- **Integrated** - Delivers insights in your workflow (Slack, Email, Webhooks)

### Five Parallel Tracks

Each track addresses a critical research need:

1. **Continuous Insight Mining** - Replaces expensive analytics consultants
2. **Buyer Reality Checks** - Replaces buyer persona research
3. **User Experience Guardrails** - Replaces UX audits
4. **Concept Interrogation** - Replaces pre-mortem workshops
5. **Brand Consistency** - Replaces brand audits

### Cost Efficiency

**Traditional approach:**
- User research consultant: $10K-50K/month
- Analytics tools: $500-3K/month (data only, no insights)
- One-time studies: $5K-20K per study

**Fieldnotes:**
- $150-300/month for internal use
- 90% cheaper than alternatives
- Continuous insights (not one-time)
- Integrated into workflow

## Value Proposition

### For Internal Use (Storytailor)

1. **Early risk detection** - Catch problems before shipping
2. **Uncomfortable truths** - Surface what teams are lying to themselves about
3. **Data-driven decisions** - Replace gut feelings with evidence
4. **Cost-effective** - $150-300/month vs $10K-50K/month for consultants
5. **Always-on** - Never miss patterns because research wasn't scheduled

### For Future External Customers

1. **Affordable research** - $299-1,999/month vs $10K-50K/month
2. **Integration-native** - Works in Slack, Email, Make.com, Zapier
3. **Multi-tenant ready** - Isolated data, custom personas per customer
4. **High margin** - 73-83% margin on starter tier
5. **Scalable** - Cost grows linearly, not exponentially

## Strategic Value

### Risk Mitigation

Fieldnotes prevents costly mistakes:
- **Pre-mortem analysis** - Catch problems before building
- **Early warning** - Surface risks weeks before they become issues
- **Data-backed challenges** - Question decisions with evidence

### Competitive Advantage

1. **Faster iteration** - Weekly insights vs quarterly studies
2. **Better decisions** - Data-driven, not opinion-driven
3. **Cost efficiency** - 90% cheaper than alternatives
4. **Integration-native** - Works where teams work

### Future Product Opportunity

Fieldnotes is designed for future productization:
- **Multi-tenant architecture** - Ready for external customers
- **API-first design** - No dashboard required
- **Integration-native** - Native to Slack, Email, Webhooks
- **High margin** - 73-83% margin potential

## Why Adversarial?

Most research tools summarize feedback. Fieldnotes challenges assumptions:

- **Self-deception detection** - Finds when teams are lying to themselves
- **Uncomfortable truths** - Surfaces facts that challenge assumptions
- **Agent interrogation** - Can challenge other agents' outputs
- **Tension mapping** - Identifies conflicting priorities

This adversarial approach prevents groupthink and ensures data-driven decisions.

## Why Integration-Native?

Traditional research tools require:
- Logging into a dashboard
- Checking reports manually
- Exporting insights to share

Fieldnotes delivers insights WHERE YOU WORK:
- Slack channels (automatic weekly briefs)
- Email inbox (scheduled reports)
- Webhooks (Make.com, Zapier, Buildship)
- Your internal tools

**No dashboard to check. No login required. Just insights in your workflow.**

## Why Multi-Tenant?

Fieldnotes is multi-tenant from day 1:
- **Storytailor**: Tenant #1 (internal use)
- **Future customers**: Ready for external productization
- **Isolated data**: RLS policies ensure tenant isolation
- **Custom personas**: Each tenant has buyer + user personas
- **Independent costs**: Per-tenant budgets and limits

This architecture enables future SaaS productization without major refactoring.

## Success Metrics

Fieldnotes success is measured by:

1. **Insights generated** - Number of actionable insights per week
2. **Risk prevention** - Problems caught before shipping
3. **Cost efficiency** - Staying under $300/month for internal use
4. **Adoption** - Teams using insights to make decisions
5. **ROI** - Value of insights vs cost of operation

**Example ROI:**
- One insight: "Quick Story mode" → +35% completion → +200 users/week → $2,400/month ARR
- Cost: $200/month
- ROI: 12x first month, infinite thereafter
