## Journey 3: Transferring Story Between Libraries

**Moving a story from one library to another.**

  - Lily's Library (daughter, Dad has Admin access)
  - Family Library (shared library)
- Dad selects: "Lily's Library"

**Step 3: Choose Transfer Type**
- **Move:** Story leaves Dad's library, goes to Lily's
- **Copy:** Story stays in Dad's library, copy goes to Lily's
- Dad selects: "Move"

**Step 4: Confirm Transfer**
