# Image Catalog - Organized Image Index

## Purpose

This document provides an organized index of all example images generated by Storytailor's inclusivity system, organized by trait, species, age, and breakthrough moments.

## Organization Structure

### By Trait

**Directory:** `by-trait/`

**Structure:**
- Each of 39 traits has its own subdirectory
- Examples showing trait on different species
- Examples showing trait at different ages
- Examples showing trait with different ethnicities

**Use Cases:**
- Technical demos (show specific trait)
- Marketing materials (showcase representation)
- Research documentation (trait validation)

### By Species

**Directory:** `by-species/`

**Structure:**
- Each of 9 species has its own subdirectory
- Examples showing different traits on that species
- Examples showing species anatomy correctness

**Use Cases:**
- Species universality demos (any trait on any species)
- Anatomy validation (not "human in costume")
- Research documentation (species adaptation)

### By Age

**Directory:** `by-age/`

**Structure:**
- Ages 4-10 (developmental stages)
- Examples showing age-appropriate representation
- Examples showing trait adaptation per age

**Use Cases:**
- Age-appropriateness validation
- Developmental stage documentation
- Research documentation (age validation)

### Breakthrough Moments

**Directory:** `breakthrough-moments/`

**Structure:**
- Dragon + Down syndrome (species-first language breakthrough)
- Halo device age 8 (Power Detection Crown breakthrough)
- Robot + prosthetic (species-adaptive design breakthrough)
- Alien + wheelchair (rocket vehicle transformation breakthrough)

**Use Cases:**
- Historical documentation (breakthrough moments)
- Research documentation (solution validation)
- Marketing materials (achievement showcase)

### Before/After

**Directory:** `before-after/`

**Structure:**
- Before: Medical language (filter rejection)
- After: Power Detection Crown (filter success)
- Before: Generic description ("human in costume")
- After: Species-first language (recognizable features)

**Use Cases:**
- Process documentation (iteration journey)
- Research documentation (solution validation)
- Marketing materials (improvement showcase)

- Superhero in wheelchair (rocket vehicle transformation)

**Halo Device:**
- Human with halo (Power Detection Crown - superhero)
- Superhero with halo (Energy Crown)
- Fantasy being with halo (Magical Crown of Stars)
- Robot with halo (Integrated head stabilization system)

**Prosthetics:**
- Robot with prosthetic (mechanical upgrade)
- Dragon with prosthetic (enhanced limb)
- Human with prosthetic (medically accurate)

**Hearing Aids:**
- Monster with hearing aids (visible on monster ears)
- Robot with hearing aids (audio processors)
- Human with hearing aids (medically accurate)

**Port-a-Cath:**
- Superhero with port (power infusion system)
- Fantasy being with port (magical crystal port)
- Human with port (medically accurate)

**And 7 more device traits...**

## Captions and Context

### For Marketing

**Focus:** Impact and emotion (not technical details)

**Example Caption:**
"A child with Down syndrome can be a dragon with recognizable features. Mother can say 'That dragon has Down syndrome too!' and child feels 'That's ME as a hero!'"

### For Technical Demos

**Focus:** Technical achievement (trait visibility, species adaptation)

**Example Caption:**
"Dragon with Down syndrome using species-first language: 'DRAGON EYES (reptilian, NOT human) with ALMOND SHAPE.' Result: Recognizable DS features on dragon, not 'human in costume.'"

### For Research

**Focus:** Methodology and results (validation, success rates)

**Example Caption:**
"Halo device (Power Detection Crown) - 8/8 tests passed (ages 5-8, diverse ethnicities). Zero-medical language, absolute identity statements, pure capability framing. Universal success."

## Which to Use for Marketing vs Technical Demos

### Marketing Materials

**Use:**
- Breakthrough moments (emotional impact)
- Before/after (improvement showcase)
- Species universality (any trait on any species)

**Avoid:**
- Technical details (prompt engineering)
- Validation metrics (too technical)
- Implementation specifics (competitive intelligence)

### Technical Demos

**Use:**
- By trait (show specific trait)
- By species (show species adaptation)
- Before/after (show solution validation)

**Include:**
- Technical achievement (trait visibility)
- Species adaptation (not "human in costume")
- Validation success (filter success, trait visibility)
