- ❌ "3,442 lines of proprietary trait logic"

### Prompt Engineering

- ❌ "We use MANDATORY language in prompts"

- ❌ "Context selection algorithm determines medical vs imagination"

### Testing Strategies

- ❌ "2-3 second spacing between tests"
- ❌ "Fail-fast validation strategies"
- ❌ "Exponential backoff on rate limits"
- ❌ "Controlled scientific testing isolating variables"

### Exact Trait Descriptions

- ❌ "POWER DETECTION CROWN with glowing sensors"

- ❌ Specific prompt language (competitive advantage)

## Sound Bites and Quotables

### Short (Tweet-length)

- "Every child deserves to see themselves as the hero."
- "39 traits. 9 species. Infinite possibilities."
- "We did it without ever asking for your child's photo."
- "It's always worth it if we can get a child to see themselves."

### Medium (LinkedIn post)

- "This year, we achieved universal inclusive AI-generated imagery - 39 traits working across 9 species, with 100% filter success. Every child can now see themselves as the hero they imagine."
- "We chose the harder path: NO photo uploads required. Child safety and trust matter more than convenience. The result? Every child feels powerful, capable, and celebrated."

### Long (Article/Thought Leadership)

- "For too long, AI image generation has excluded children with disabilities, medical devices, or diverse appearances. We changed that. Storytailor now supports 39 inclusivity traits across 9 species - from wheelchairs to prosthetics, from Down syndrome to vitiligo. Every single trait works universally. And we did it without ever asking families to upload photos of their children."

## Hashtag Strategy

### Primary Hashtags

- `#InclusiveAI`
- `#RepresentationMatters`
- `#EveryChildIsAHero`
- `#AccessibilityTech`
- `#InclusiveStorytelling`

### Secondary Hashtags

- `#DisabilityRepresentation`
- `#AIForGood`
- `#ChildSafety`
- `#TherapeuticStorytelling`
- `#InclusiveDesign`

### Avoid

- `#PromptEngineering` (too technical)
- `#AIBias` (negative framing)
- `#MedicalDevices` (too clinical)

## Tone Guidelines

### Always

- Celebratory (achievement, not charity)
- Empowering (children are powerful, not pitied)
- Mission-driven (that child in hospital)
- Results-focused (proven, not claimed)

### Never

- Pity/charity framing ("poor children")
- Inspiration porn ("overcoming disability")
- Technical jargon (competitive intelligence)
- Self-congratulatory (acknowledge tensions)

## Competitive Intelligence Protection

### What We Share

- Impact and results (what we achieved)
- Mission and values (why we did it)
- Scale and scope (39 traits, 9 species)
- Ethical choices (NO photo uploads)

### What We Protect

- How we did it (prompt engineering, validation logic)
- Exact patterns (wheelchair pattern, species-first language)
- Test strategies (spacing, validation stages)
- Trait descriptions (competitive advantage)
