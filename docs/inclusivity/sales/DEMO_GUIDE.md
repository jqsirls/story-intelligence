# Demo Guide - Live Demo Script

## Pre-Demo Setup

### Technical Preparation
- [ ] Test image generation (verify all traits work)
- [ ] Prepare example images (dragon+DS, robot+prosthetic, etc.)
- [ ] Have backup images ready (in case generation fails)
- [ ] Test internet connection (for live generation)

### Audience Preparation
- [ ] Understand audience (hospitals, schools, medical orgs, consultants)
- [ ] Identify which traits matter most to their children
- [ ] Prepare relevant examples for their use case

## Demo Sequence 1: Species Universality

### Opening

"Let me show you something remarkable. A child with Down syndrome wants to be a dragon. Most AI systems either generate a human child with dragon features - 'human in costume' - or they 'fix' the Down syndrome features. We do neither."

### Demo Steps

1. **Generate Dragon with Down Syndrome**
   - Show prompt building (species-first language)
   - Generate image
   - Point out: "Almond dragon eyes, softer snout - recognizable as 'has DS too!'"

2. **Generate Robot with Prosthetic**
   - Show species-adaptive design
   - Generate image
   - Point out: "Prosthetic integrated as robot upgrade, not limitation"

3. **Generate Alien in Wheelchair**
   - Show transformation (wheelchair → rocket vehicle)
   - Generate image
   - Point out: "Wheelchair transformed to rocket vehicle, not medical limitation"

### Wow Moment

"We have 39 traits. Every single one works. Pick any combination. Dragon with Down syndrome and wheelchair? Done. Robot with prosthetic and vitiligo? Done. Alien with halo device and burn scars? Done."

### Closing Question

"Which traits matter most to YOUR children? Let's show you how Storytailor represents them authentically."

## Demo Sequence 2: Device Transformations

### Opening

"Devices don't limit children - they empower them. Let me show you how we transform medical devices into superhero equipment."

### Demo Steps

1. **Wheelchair Transformation**
   - Show: Human child, superhero context
   - Generate: Wheelchair → rocket-powered hero vehicle
   - Point out: "Device becomes power, not limitation"

2. **Halo Device Transformation**
   - Show: Human child, superhero context
   - Generate: Halo device → power detection crown
   - Point out: "Zero-medical language, pure capability framing"

3. **Prosthetic Transformation**
   - Show: Robot, superhero context
   - Generate: Prosthetic → robot upgrade
   - Point out: "Species-adaptive design, not medical limitation"

### Wow Moment

"Every device transforms. Wheelchair becomes rocket vehicle. Halo becomes power crown. Prosthetic becomes robot upgrade. Children see devices as power, not limitation."

### Closing Question

"Which devices do YOUR children use? Let's show you how Storytailor transforms them."

## Demo Sequence 3: Structural Traits

### Opening

"Structural traits - Down syndrome, facial differences, dwarfism, limb differences - work universally across all species. Let me show you."

### Demo Steps

1. **Down Syndrome on Dragon**
   - Generate: Dragon with DS features
   - Point out: "Almond dragon eyes, softer snout - recognizable as 'has DS too!'"

2. **Facial Differences on Robot**
   - Generate: Robot with adapted design
   - Point out: "Design philosophy, not medical limitation"

3. **Limb Differences on Monster**
   - Generate: Monster with anatomically correct absence
   - Point out: "Species anatomy correct, not human in costume"

### Wow Moment

"Every structural trait recognizable on every species. Mother can say 'That dragon has Down syndrome too!' and child feels 'That's ME as a hero!'"

### Closing Question

"Which structural traits matter most to YOUR children? Let's show you how Storytailor represents them."

## Demo Sequence 4: Surface Representation

### Opening

"Surface traits - vitiligo, burn scars, albinism, skin tones - are preserved authentically, not 'fixed' by AI."

### Demo Steps

1. **Vitiligo on Alien**
   - Generate: Alien with vitiligo pattern
   - Point out: "Pattern preserved, not 'fixed'"

2. **Burn Scars on Robot**
   - Generate: Robot with textured panels
   - Point out: "Scars visible, celebrated, not hidden"

3. **Albinism on Dragon**
   - Generate: Dragon with pale scales
   - Point out: "Trait visible, not 'fixed'"

### Wow Moment

"Every surface trait preserved authentically. Children see their unique features as beautiful, not something to hide."

### Closing Question

"Which surface traits matter most to YOUR children? Let's show you how Storytailor preserves them."

## Demo Sequence 5: Emotional Safety

### Opening

"Trust and safety matter. Let me show you how we prioritize child safety."

### Demo Points

1. **NO Photo Uploads**
   - Show: Text-only input
   - Point out: "We chose the harder path - text-only to accurate representation - because child safety matters more than convenience"

2. **COPPA/GDPR Compliance**
   - Show: Compliance infrastructure
   - Point out: "Real investment in compliance, not minimum compliance"

3. **Professional Consultation**
   - Show: Consultation structure
   - Point out: "Medical, cultural, disability advocate review - ongoing accountability"

### Wow Moment

"Parents trust us because we chose the harder path. Children are safe because we prioritize safety."

### Closing Question

"Trust and safety matter to you, right? Let's show you how Storytailor delivers both."
