## Objection Handling

### "Is This Just Political Correctness?"

**Response:**
"This is about authentic representation, not political correctness. Children with disabilities, medical devices, or diverse appearances deserve to see themselves as heroes - not as limitations, not as 'fixed' versions of themselves, but as powerful, capable individuals. This is mission-driven, not performative."

### "We Have Other Tools"

**Response:**
"Other tools may support 3-4 traits as showcase examples. We support 39 traits universally. Any trait on any species. Not just human characters - dragons, robots, aliens, monsters. Universal inclusivity, not token gestures."

### "Too Expensive"

**Response:**
"Consider the therapeutic value per child. For hospitals, improved patient engagement and outcomes. For schools, better student engagement and educational outcomes. For medical organizations, member value and community engagement. The cost is an investment in authentic representation and therapeutic value."

### "Privacy Concerns"

**Response:**
"We don't ask for photos. We chose the harder path - text-only to accurate representation - because child safety and trust matter more than convenience. We're COPPA/GDPR compliant, with real investment in compliance infrastructure, not minimum compliance."

### "We Don't Need This"

**Response:**
"Every child deserves to see themselves as the hero they imagine. If you serve children with disabilities, medical devices, or diverse appearances, this is for them. It's about authentic representation, not token gestures."
