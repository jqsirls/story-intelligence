# Trait Categories - Sales Overview

## Executive Summary

**39 inclusivity traits across 3 smart categories** that respect individual differences while ensuring accurate representation.

## The Three Categories

### Visual Traits (28) - "We Show What's There"

**Physical characteristics that are always visible**:
- Wheelchairs, prosthetics, Down syndrome, burn scars, vitiligo, limb differences, medical devices

**Why this matters**:
- Child with wheelchair ALWAYS sees wheelchair in their character
- Dragon with Down syndrome has recognizable DS features
- Burn scars celebrated, not hidden

**Competitive edge**: Most systems "smooth" these - we validate they're actually visible.

### Conditional Traits (8) - "We Respect What's Personal"

**Traits with variable presentation - we show only what family describes**:
- Autism (some wear headphones, many don't)
- ADHD (some use fidget tools, many don't)
- Type 1 diabetes (some have visible pumps, many use pens/injections)
- Asthma (often invisible unless using inhaler)

**Why this matters**:
- Respects individual differences
- No stereotyping (not all autistic children wear headphones)
- Family drives presentation

**Competitive edge**: Most systems force stereotypes - we listen to families.

### Abstract Traits (3) - "We Honor the Invisible"

**No visual manifestation - personality and story only**:
- Dyslexia (learning difference - invisible)
- Intellectual disability (cognitive difference - invisible)

**Why this matters**:
- These are real differences that shape personality
- No forced "visual markers" that don't exist
- Story integration shows strengths

**Competitive edge**: We don't try to "show" what's invisible.

## Natural Language Understanding

**Kids describe traits in their own words**:
- "Special helmet" → System knows: cranial helmet or halo device?
- "Tube for eating" → System understands: feeding tube
- "Chair with wheels" → System asks: manual or power wheelchair?

**No medical jargon required**. 6-year-old can describe in their words.

**Competitive edge**: Conversational AI + 156 natural language hints across 39 traits.

## Family Messaging

**Pitch**: 
"Your child's uniqueness - shown accurately, celebrated imaginatively"

**Visual traits**: "We show what makes them unique"  
**Conditional traits**: "We listen to how YOU describe them"  
**Abstract traits**: "We honor strengths, not stereotypes"

## ROI for Partners

**Hospitals/Medical**: Natural language = easier for families (no medical terminology)  
**Schools**: Conditional traits respect individual student presentations  
**Diversity consultants**: 3-category system shows technical sophistication
