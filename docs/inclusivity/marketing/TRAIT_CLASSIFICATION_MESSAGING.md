# Trait Classification - Marketing Messaging

## Core Message

**"Every child's uniqueness - shown with accuracy, celebrated with imagination"**

## Three-Category System (Customer-Facing)

### "We Show What's Visible"

**28 visual traits - physical characteristics we always celebrate**:
- Wheelchairs become rocket vehicles
- Down syndrome features recognizable on ANY species (even dragons!)
- Burn scars, vitiligo patterns shown with pride
- Prosthetics celebrated as cool enhancements

**Message**: "What makes your child unique physically - we show it, we celebrate it, we make it magical"

**Proof points**:
- Dragon with Down syndrome (mother can say "That dragon has DS too!")
- Wheelchair transforms (rocket vehicle for robot characters)
- 14 diverse ethnicities tested (not just white children)

### "We Respect What's Personal"

**8 conditional traits - you tell us, we listen**:
- Some autistic children wear headphones, many don't - we listen to YOU
- Some diabetic children have visible pumps, many don't - your description drives it
- Not all ADHD children use fidget tools - we respect YOUR child's presentation

**Message**: "You know your child best - describe them YOUR way, we'll get it right"

**Proof points**:
- No forced stereotypes
- Conversational AI understands natural descriptions
- "Purple headphones" → shows purple headphones
- No mention → no forced objects

### "We Honor the Invisible"

**3 abstract traits - learning/cognitive differences**:
- Dyslexia, intellectual disabilities - shown through personality, not forced "markers"
- Intelligence celebrated through strengths
- Story integration shows capabilities

**Message**: "Some differences are invisible - we honor them through personality and strengths, not stereotypes"

## Key Differentiators

**vs Generic AI**: 
- Them: Default to perfect Euro-centric features
- Us: Validate with 14 diverse ethnicities

**vs "Inclusive" Competitors**:
- Them: 3-4 showcase traits
- Us: 39 traits, ALL working universally

**vs Medical Accuracy Systems**:
- Them: Clinical descriptions
- Us: Imagination lens (wheelchair → rocket vehicle, halo → power detection crown)

## Sound Bites

- "Kids describe traits in their own words - '6-year-old says special helmet', system understands"
- "We show what's visible, respect what's personal, honor what's invisible"
- "39 traits, 3 smart categories, infinite possibilities"
- "No medical jargon, no forced stereotypes, just your unique child"

## Social Media Angles

**Visual traits**: Before/after showing imagination transformation  
**Conditional traits**: "We listen to families, not assume"  
**Natural language**: "6-year-old friendly - no big medical words needed"
