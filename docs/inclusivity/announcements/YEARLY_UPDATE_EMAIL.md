# Yearly Update Email - Inclusivity Achievement

## Celebration Blurb (150-200 words)

**Subject:** Every Child Sees Themselves as the Hero

This year, we achieved something we're incredibly proud of: **universal inclusive AI-generated imagery** that works for every child.

For too long, AI image generation has excluded children with disabilities, medical devices, or diverse appearances. When a child in a wheelchair wanted to see themselves as a dragon hero, the technology failed them. When a child with Down syndrome wanted to be a robot, the system couldn't represent them authentically.

**We changed that.**

We now support **39 inclusivity traits** across **9 species** - from wheelchairs to prosthetics, from Down syndrome to vitiligo, from hearing aids to halo devices. Every single trait works universally. A child with a halo device can be a superhero with a "power detection crown." A child with Down syndrome can be a dragon with recognizable features. A child in a wheelchair can ride a rocket-powered hero vehicle.

**Most importantly:** We did this without ever asking families to upload photos of their children. We chose the harder path because child safety and trust matter more than convenience.

The result? Every child can now see themselves as the hero they imagine - powerful, capable, and celebrated.

Try it yourself. See the magic. [Link to platform]

Because every child deserves to see themselves as the hero.
