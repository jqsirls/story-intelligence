# Story Intelligence™ Platform Description

## Platform Capability Blurb (100-150 words)

**Story Intelligence™** is the first AI platform that generates truly inclusive children's stories and imagery - where every child sees themselves as the hero.

Powered by proprietary inclusivity technology, Story Intelligence supports **39 inclusivity traits** across **9 species**, ensuring authentic representation for children with disabilities, medical devices, and diverse appearances. A child in a wheelchair becomes a hero with a rocket-powered vehicle. A child with Down syndrome becomes a dragon with recognizable features. A child with a halo device becomes a superhero with a power detection crown.

**What makes Story Intelligence unique:**

- **Universal inclusivity** - Any trait recognizable on any species (not just showcase examples)
- **Imaginative empowerment** - Devices transform into superhero equipment, not medical limitations
- **Child safety first** - NO photo uploads required (ethical choice, builds trust)
- **100% filter success** - All traits pass OpenAI safety filters across ages 5-8

Story Intelligence proves that AI can be both powerful and inclusive - when built with mission, ethics, and persistence.
