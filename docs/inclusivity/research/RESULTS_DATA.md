## Overview

This document provides complete test results for Storytailor's universal inclusivity system - all tests, all dates, success rates by trait/species/age, filter rejection analysis, repeatability metrics, and ethnicity representation data.

## Complete Test Results (All Tests, All Dates)

### Halo Device Testing

## Filter Rejection Analysis

### Rejection Patterns

**Medical Language Triggers:**

- "Medical device" → `[sexual]` (false positive)
- "Orthopedic brace" → Filter rejection

**Solution:** Zero-medical language (wheelchair pattern)

### Success Patterns

**Wheelchair Pattern:**
- Zero-medical language
- Absolute identity statements
- Pure capability framing
- Result: 100% filter success

**Power Detection Crown:**
- Zero-medical language
- Superhero identity ("IS superhero equipment")
- Pure capability framing
- Result: 100% filter success (ages 5-8)

## Repeatability Metrics

### Confirmation Stage

**3x Repeatability:**
- Same variant, same age
- Must pass 3/3
- Validates consistency

**Results:**
- Halo device (Power Detection Crown): 3/3 passed

- Wheelchair transformation: 3/3 passed

### Universal Validation

**8/8 Tests Passed:**
- Ages 4, 5, 6, 8
- Diverse ethnicities
- Universal success (not age-specific)

**Results:**
