## 🎯 Differentiation Strategy

### Category Creation Over Competition
- **Focus**: Story creation platform (new category), not "AI story app"
- **Message**: "Story creation experience, not story consumption"
- **Positioning**: We're creation time, competitors are consumption time
- **Code Reference**: [`docs/marketing/category-creation-playbook.md`](docs/marketing/category-creation-playbook.md)

### Quality Over Quantity
- **Focus**: Award-caliber stories, not volume
- **Message**: "Pulitzer-quality storytelling"
- **Differentiation**: Award-winning author's methodology, not automated generation

### Personalization Over Generic
- **Focus**: Story Intelligence™ personalization (craft systematized)
- **Message**: "Every story is uniquely tailored using award-winning author's methodology"
- **Differentiation**: Methodology-based, not template-based

### Safety Over Convenience

**Language Rules:**
- Never describe competitors as "AI story apps" (positions us WITH them)
- Use "automated content generation" or "template-based personalization"
- Emphasize different category, not better technology
