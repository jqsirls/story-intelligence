## When to Talk About AI (and When NOT To)

### Proactive Mentions: Only in Transparency/Education Content

**When to Proactively Mention:**
- Educational blog posts about AI ethics
- Transparency content about our practices
- Thought leadership on responsible AI use
- Educational content about our methodology

**Language:**
- "We use OpenAI's GPT models as foundation technology"
- "Story Intelligence is my methodology executed using foundation models"
- "The ethics of AI training data is an evolving question"
- "I focus on what I can control: my methodology, output, transparency"

**Platforms:**
- Blog (long-form thought leadership)
- LinkedIn (professional transparency)
- YouTube (educational content)
- Email (educational newsletters)

### Reactive Mentions: When Directly Asked

**When Asked: "What AI do you use?"**

**Answer:**
"We use OpenAI's GPT models as foundation technology, combined with our proprietary Story Intelligence methodology developed by award-winning author JQ Sirls. Story Intelligence is his storytelling framework - like a master chef creating a cookbook of techniques."

**When Asked: "Is this AI-generated?"**

**Answer:**
"We use Story Intelligence™ - our proprietary technology that combines narrative mastery, child development expertise, and therapeutic insights. It's not just AI generating content; it's intelligent understanding that creates award-caliber stories uniquely tailored to each child."

**Key Points:**
- Acknowledge foundation model use
- Emphasize our original methodology
- Position as tools, not the product
- Reference JQ's credentials

### Never Lead With: "AI-Powered" or Technology Descriptions

**What NOT to Lead With:**
- "AI-powered stories"
- "Artificial intelligence creates..."
- "Machine learning generates..."
- "Advanced AI technology"

**Why:**
- Positions us IN the AI category
- Focuses on technology, not experience
- Competes with "AI story apps"
- Not our differentiation

### Always Lead With: Outcomes, Creator Story, Methodology

**What to Lead With:**
- "Create award-caliber stories with your child"
- "Award-winning author JQ Sirls' storytelling methodology"
- "Story creation experience powered by Story Intelligence"
- "Family storytelling platform"

**Why:**
- Focuses on value, not technology
- Emphasizes creator credibility
- Positions as experience, not product
- Differentiates from competitors

## Response Templates for Common Criticisms

### "You're stealing from artists"

**Response:**
"I'm an award-winning children's author and illustrator myself (IPPY and Moonbeam winner), so I understand this concern deeply. Story Intelligence is my craft systematized - I'm not using AI to fill gaps in what I can't do, I'm sharing what I CAN do at scale. We create new, transformative works, not reproductions.
