## Common Objections & Responses

### 1. "It's too expensive"

**Response**:
"At $9.99/month, that's less than a coffee per week for unlimited award-quality personalized stories. Compare that to buying children's books at $10-15 each, and you're saving money while getting stories perfectly tailored to your child."

**Alternative**:
"We have a free tier so you can try it risk-free. If you love it, the Family Tier is just $9.99/month - less than most streaming services."

### 2. "I can just use ChatGPT or other AI"

**Response**:
"ChatGPT creates generic content. Story Intelligence™ combines narrative mastery, child development expertise, and therapeutic insights. Our stories are Pulitzer-quality and perfectly age-appropriate. Plus, we're COPPA-compliant and built specifically for children's safety."

**Key Differentiators**:
- Award-caliber quality (not generic AI)
