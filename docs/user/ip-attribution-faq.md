# IP Attribution - User FAQ

**Audience**: End Users | Parents | Educators

## What is IP Attribution?

When your child creates a story with a character like Batman, Spiderman, or Elsa, we automatically detect that character and add a small note crediting the original creators. This is similar to how a child's drawing of their favorite character includes the character's name - it's a way to give proper credit.

## Why Do You Add Attribution?

We believe in giving credit where credit is due. When copyrighted characters appear in stories, we want to make sure everyone knows who created those characters originally.

## What Does the Attribution Say?

The attribution includes:
- Which character was detected (e.g., "Batman")
- Who owns that character (e.g., "DC Comics")
- A note that the story is for personal enjoyment only
- A clear statement that we are not the owners of the character

## Where Do I See Attribution?

Attribution appears:
- In the story metadata (available in API responses)
- In conversational responses (Alexa, chat) as a quiet note
- When sharing stories (automatically included)

The attribution is designed to be clear but not disruptive - like a photo credit in a magazine.

## Can I Still Use Copyrighted Characters?

Yes! Stories with copyrighted characters are for your family's personal enjoyment only. Think of it like a child drawing their favorite character - it's a personal creation, not a commercial product.

**What's Allowed:**
- Personal family use
- Sharing with family and friends
- Educational use (with attribution)
- Therapeutic use (with attribution)

**What's NOT Allowed:**
- Commercial publication
- Selling stories with copyrighted characters
- Public distribution without attribution
- Commercial use of copyrighted characters

## What If Attribution is Missing?

If you notice a copyrighted character that wasn't attributed, you can report it:
- Use the "Report IP Issue" option (available in story metadata)
- Our system will automatically review and add attribution if needed
- You'll be notified when the issue is resolved

## What If Attribution is Wrong?

If you believe a character was incorrectly identified as copyrighted (false positive), you can report it:
- Use the "Report IP Issue" option
- Select "False Positive" as the issue type
- Our team will review and correct it

## Is My Child's Story Safe?

Yes! Stories are stored securely and are only accessible to you and your family. IP attribution is just a way to give proper credit - it doesn't affect your story's privacy or security.

## How Does Detection Work?

Our system uses:
- Character name matching (exact and fuzzy)
- Story content pattern analysis
- A database of 200+ characters across 30+ major franchises

**Detected Franchises Include:**
- Superheroes (Marvel, DC Comics)
- Disney characters and franchises
- Global kids favorites (PAW Patrol, Bluey, SpongeBob, Peppa Pig, Pokémon, Minecraft, Roblox, LEGO, Barbie)
- Anime & International (Doraemon, Naruto, One Piece, Little Witch Academia, Pocoyo, Dragon Ball)
- And many more popular copyrighted characters

The system is designed to be accurate, but if you notice any issues, please report them so we can improve.
