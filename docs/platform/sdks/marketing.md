# Storytailor SDKs - Marketing Information

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-17

## Value Proposition

Storytailor SDKs provide type-safe, platform-optimized integration libraries that simplify Storytailor integration for developers building native mobile apps and web applications, significantly reducing development time and ensuring best-in-class performance.

## Key Marketing Messages

- **"Type-Safe Integration"**: Integrate with Storytailor using type-safe APIs with full IDE autocomplete. TypeScript, Swift, and Kotlin support catch errors at compile time, not runtime.
- **"Platform-Optimized"**: Native SDKs optimized for each platform (Web, iOS, Android, React Native) ensure best performance and native user experience.
- **"Offline-First"**: Built-in offline support with local caching means your app works even without internet connection. No need to implement offline logic from scratch.

## Target Audience Messaging

### For Mobile Developers

- "Build native iOS and Android apps with Storytailor integration in minutes. Type-safe APIs, offline support, and platform-specific optimizations ensure best performance and user experience."
- "Access Storytailor capabilities through native SDKs that respect platform design guidelines. iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design - we've got you covered."
- "Offline support built-in. Local caching, automatic sync, and background tasks - everything you need for a seamless offline experience."

### For Web Developers

- "Integrate Storytailor into your web app with TypeScript support and full type definitions. IDE autocomplete, compile-time error checking, and framework support (React, Vue, Angular)."
- "Progressive Web App (PWA) support with Service Worker integration. Offline functionality, real-time updates via WebSocket, and efficient caching - all built-in."
- "Works with your favorite framework. React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript - choose what works best for your project."

### For React Native Developers

- "Cross-platform Storytailor integration with React Native SDK. Write once, run on iOS and Android with platform-specific optimizations."
- "Shared codebase for iOS and Android. One SDK, two platforms, consistent API across both."
- "Native performance with React Native bridge. Access native features while maintaining cross-platform compatibility."

### For Platform Partners

- "Storytailor provides comprehensive SDK support for Web, iOS, Android, and React Native, making it easy for developers to integrate Storytailor into their applications."
- "Type-safe APIs reduce integration errors and support burden. Developers get IDE autocomplete and compile-time error checking."
- "Production-ready SDKs with offline support, real-time updates, and platform-specific optimizations demonstrate Storytailor's technical excellence."
